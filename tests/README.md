# Automated testing for Assignment 1

If you're a student reading this, you can learn how this is tested and we'll speak of how this is done in the second level of the course.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Just because the tests fail does not *necessarily* mean you won't do well on this assignment. The same thing goes if the tests pass. It does not *necessarily* mean you'll get 100%

## Pre Requisites
node.js and npm.

## Students Looking at this.
You'll need node.js installed (this is done later in the course), you'll get there if you're reading this and you think it's neat.

## Instructors using this.
You can use this as not a perfect way of marking but will add a lot of context for the student as they are working on their assignments.

## Running the tests.
1. install dependencies in this folder `npm install`
2. run the command `npm run test:components` to run only the component tests.
3. run the command `npm run test:app` to run a test of the entire application.

## Testing Environment
All of the tests are contained in `cypress/e2e/` if you want to take a look at them.
